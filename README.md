Farmers have always used information about wind and weather to know when to plant and harvest. Recent development and dissemination of advanced technological tools at an affordable price have resulted in both large and small-scale farmers having new and more precise tools to produce more with less. Farming takes skills. You have to know when to plant, when to water, when to fertilize and when to harvest. You need to know how to protect your crop from pests and from spoiling after harvest, and you need to know what the proper price is for your produce. Luckily, farmers worldwide are facing a suite of technological advances that can assist them in growing more food and bring more of it to market at a fair price. The opportunity for making farming smarter can increase yields and profits and reduce the use of precious water and fertilizer. Hence, I believe that smart farming project will step towards the progress of scientific and modern cultivation. In summary, this system will help the farmers involve with farming in every smart way, in one single platform.
